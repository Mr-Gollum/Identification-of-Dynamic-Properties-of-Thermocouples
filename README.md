# Identification-of-Dynamic-Properties-of-Thermocouples
The work aims to identify the characteristics of thermocouples such as SP1848-27145 to 
obtain a functional measurement system. This system is controlled by ESP32, wirelessly 
operated by a computer. The microcontroller control application is developed in C# .NET 
language, with communication secured via Bluetooth serial. The created system records 
essential information such as the voltage generated by the thermocouples under various 
temperature conditions. Voltage is measured using the ADS1115 converter, temperatures 
using DS18B20 sensors, and current and power are both computed. All information is 
displayed in the application, from which graphs and raw data can be exported for further 
processing if needed.

# Identification-of-Dynamic-Properties-of-Thermocouples
The work aims to identify the characteristics of thermocouples such as SP1848-27145 to 
obtain a functional measurement system. This system is controlled by ESP32 and wirelessly 
operated by a computer. The microcontroller control application is developed in C# .NET 
language, with communication secured via Bluetooth serial. The created system records 
essential information such as the voltage generated by the thermocouples under various 
temperature conditions. Voltage is measured using the ADS1115 converter, temperatures 
using DS18B20 sensors, and current and power are both computed. All information is 
displayed in the application, from which graphs and raw data can be exported for further 
processing.

Set desired and maximal temperature, resistor value, COM ports, and operating mode in settings. 
After measurement, you can export data with the export button. The app will ask you if you want to keep data in charts. If you want to keep it click yes (Data export + keep data). If you do not need data in charts select "no" (Data export + clear data). If yoou want to break operation (export) then click "cancel" (No data export + keep data). 
Data will look like in file
